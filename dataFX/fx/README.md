This folder contains the logic for the JavaFX interpretation of the
CSC backend designed by Alex McColm. Currently, this Diagrammer App file consists
of both View and Controller while utilizing Alex's Model files, but 
I think there would be benefit and less clutter to separate the View
and Controller aspects into separate files.
 
It may not be pretty, but it is functional. It has been designed to be 
able to use Alex's backend files with little or no modifications needed
on them.
  
I also think that we should add a home button to be able to restart the app at 
any time including when the images are being displayed.
