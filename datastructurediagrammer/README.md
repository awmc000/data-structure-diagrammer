# How it works

## Technologies used
## Principles and design patterns used
Version numbers will be conformant to semantic versioning as described on https://semver.org/.

> Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:  
MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes  
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner  
PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
