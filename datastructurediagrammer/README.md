## How to use it

First, download a `.jar` file from the "releases" page of this repository.

### Generating a diagram of a binary search tree
Entered in the same directory as the `.jar` resides in, this command will generate a binary search tree containing the numbers 4, 3, 2, 1.
```
java -jar datastructurediagrammer-0.01.jar binarytree int 4 3 2 1
```

# How it works

## Technologies used
## Principles and design patterns used
Version numbers will be conformant to semantic versioning as described on https://semver.org/.

> Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:  
MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes  
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner  
PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes
